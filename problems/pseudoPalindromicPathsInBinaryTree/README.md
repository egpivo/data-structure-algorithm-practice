## [Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/description)
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

- Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2
```

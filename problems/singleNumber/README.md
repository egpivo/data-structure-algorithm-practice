## [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/accounts/login/?next=/submissions/detail/388422343/%3Ffrom%3D/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3283/)

Given a *non-empty* array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

*Follow up*: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?


- Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

- Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

- Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

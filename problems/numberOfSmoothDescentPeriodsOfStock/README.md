## [Single NumberII](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

- Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

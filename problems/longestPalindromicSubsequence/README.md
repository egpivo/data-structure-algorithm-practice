## [Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/description/)
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


- Example 1:
```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
```

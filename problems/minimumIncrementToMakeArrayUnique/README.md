## [Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/description/)


You are given an integer array nums. In one move, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and increment nums[i] by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in nums unique.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.



- Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
```

## [Minimum Common Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-common-value/description/)

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1.

Note that an integer is said to be common to nums1 and nums2 if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.




- Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]
Output: 2
```

## [Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)
You have a graph of `n` nodes. You are given an integer `n` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.


```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
```

## [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/description/)

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.


- Example
```
Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]
```

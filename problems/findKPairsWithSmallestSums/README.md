## [Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums)
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer k.

Define a pair (u, v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

Return the k pairs (u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk) with the smallest sums.

- Example
```
Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3
Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]
```

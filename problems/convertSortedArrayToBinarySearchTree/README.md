## [Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree)

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a
height-balanced binary search tree.


- Example:
```
Given the sorted list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

     0
    / \
  -3   9
  /   /
-10  5
```

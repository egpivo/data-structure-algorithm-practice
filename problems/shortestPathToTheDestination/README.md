## [Shortest path to the destination](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/1563/description?_from=problem_tag&fromId=72)
Given a 2D array representing the coordinates on the map, there are only values 0, 1, 2 on the map. value 0 means that it can pass, value 1 means not passable, value 2 means target place. Starting from the coordinates [0,0],You can only go up, down, left and right. Find the shortest path that can reach the destination, and return the length of the path.


```
Input:
[
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 2]
]
Output: 4

## [Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/description/)


There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.


- Example:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
```

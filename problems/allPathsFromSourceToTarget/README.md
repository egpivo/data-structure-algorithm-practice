## [All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/graph/620/breadth-first-search-in-graph/3853/)
Given a directed acyclic graph **(DAG)** of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).


```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

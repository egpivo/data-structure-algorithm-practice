## [Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-empty/)

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

- Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
- Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.

## [Maximum Odd Binary Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-odd-binary-number/description/)
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.

You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.

Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.



- Example:

```
Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
```

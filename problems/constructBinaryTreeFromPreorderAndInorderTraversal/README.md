## [Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal)

Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.
Example:
```
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

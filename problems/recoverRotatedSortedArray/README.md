Given a rotated sorted array, recover it to sorted array in-place.

- Example:
'''
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
'''

- Challenge: in-place, O(1) extra space and O(n) time.

- Clarification: What is rotated array:
        - For example, the orginal array is [1,2,3,4], The rotated array of it can be [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,1], [3,4,1,2], [4,1,2,3]

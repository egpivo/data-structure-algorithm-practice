## [Sum of All Subset XOR Totals](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-subset-xor-totals/description)

The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.

- For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.
Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.

Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.

An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.

- Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,1,6]
Output: 28
```

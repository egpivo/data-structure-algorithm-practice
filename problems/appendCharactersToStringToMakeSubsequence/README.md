## [Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/description/)


You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.




- Example 1:
```
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
```

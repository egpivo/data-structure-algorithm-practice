## [Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/description/)

Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.



- Example:
```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]
```

## [Minimum Falling Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/)

Given an n x n integer matrix grid, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

A falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of grid such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.


#### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
```

## [Reverse Prefix of Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/description/)

Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

- For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.


- Example 1:
```
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
```

## [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/description/)

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.



- Example 1:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8
```

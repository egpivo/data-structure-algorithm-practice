## [Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/description/)

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of good subarrays of nums.

A good array is an array where the number of different integers in that array is exactly k.

For example, `[1,2,3,1,2]` has `3` different integers: 1, 2, and 3.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.



- Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: 7
```

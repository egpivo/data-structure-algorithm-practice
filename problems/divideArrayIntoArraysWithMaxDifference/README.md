## [Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference/)
You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

- Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
- The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.



- Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
```

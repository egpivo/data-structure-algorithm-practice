## [Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x/description/)

You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x.

Notice that x does not have to be an element in nums.

Return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.



- Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,5]
Output: 2
```

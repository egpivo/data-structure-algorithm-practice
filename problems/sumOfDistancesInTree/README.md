## [Sum of Distances in Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/description/)

There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

You are given the integer n and the array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the sum of the distances between the ith node in the tree and all other nodes.

- Example:
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
```

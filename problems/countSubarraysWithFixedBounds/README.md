## [Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-fixed-bounds/description/)

You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.

A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.
Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.



- Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,7,5], minK = 1, maxK = 5
Output: 2
```

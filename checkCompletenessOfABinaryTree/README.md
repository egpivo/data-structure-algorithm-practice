## [Check Completeness of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the **right side** of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
- Example:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```

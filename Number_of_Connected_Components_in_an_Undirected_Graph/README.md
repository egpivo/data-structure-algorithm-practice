## [Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example:
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
Output: 2

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Output: 1
```

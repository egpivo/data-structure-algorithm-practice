## [Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return ***the vertical order traversal*** of its nodes' values. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from ***left to right***.




- Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
```
